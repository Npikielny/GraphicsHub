# GraphicsHub
A compilation of all of the graphics projects I have made over the last year.
Every project will have easy to use inputs, as well as some generic inputs, which allow for recording (currently a directory of photos, but this will hopefully become a video in the comming months).
## Projects
### Fluid Dynamics

### Path Tracing and Ray Tracing

### Video Recording:
Certain parameters for each renderer can be animated through linear interpolation, quadratic interpolation, or a sine curve, and the result can be saved as a set of images:

### Coming soon
- Boids Flocking Simulation
- Improved fluid simulation
- Refraction in ray tracing and path tracing
This README is not updated regularly, so it may include or exclude projects on the main branch.
