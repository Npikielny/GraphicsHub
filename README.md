# GraphicsHub
A compilation of all of the graphics projects I have made over the last year.
Every project will have easy to use inputs, as well as some generic inputs, which allow for recording (currently a directory of photos, but this will hopefully become a video in the comming months).
## Projects
### Complex Imager
A pipeline to render Julia sets and the Mandelbrot set.

### Tests
So far I have written basic tests for rasterization and a pipeline that enables easy setup for any rendering engine, which should renderr images in segments to limit GPU load.

### Coming soon
- Ray Tracing
- Ray Marching
- Boids Flocking Simulation (Probably coupled with the ray marching engine)
- Slime Mold Simulation
- Water Simulation (This one will probably take a while)
This README is not synchronized with the main branch, so it may include or exclude projects on the main branch.
